### Hi there 👋

My name is David Trinh. I was born and raised in Littleton, and go to school in Denver, (CU-Denver). I am super into tennis, skiing, raves, design, and watches! I love to read anything from business to illustrated light novels. I volunteer regularly and am passionate about social good and technology. 

With my brother, on the side, I am working to grow Trinite Méson and disrupt the real estate media industry. My job is to find and recruit current and future amazing creatives and tech-savvy individuals to build an amazing brand for our clients. 

Currently, I am Pursuing a bachelor of science, in business administration; Management Information Systems, and Accounting; Minor in Finance. At the University of Colorado Denver, I run the first Commerical Real Estate club where we recruit students across different disciplines and equip them with the critical and creative aptitude to participate in the real estate industry. 

I have a passion for building teams to develop something people want. I am actively looking for ways to provide value by integrating media and technology to make business better. I hope to eventually transition into private equity and provide value by deploying capital.


I enjoy meeting new people and hearing new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk about tech, media, or just about anything! I’m excited to uncover new opportunities and connect with individuals across different industries!

I hope to connect!
